- Explain when and why to mint a DOI with Zenodo.
- **Supporting others:** advise which DOI, version or concept, belongs in a given citation.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Why a repository is not an archive

A GitHub repository is a workshop, not an archive. The code changes daily, the URL can break, and "the version we used" means nothing without a marker. This episode adds the two things scholarly infrastructure needs to take software seriously: a **release**, which freezes a named version, and a **Zenodo DOI**, which gives that frozen version a persistent identifier and a preservation copy outside GitHub entirely. After this step, the software can be cited like an article, and the citation still resolves in 20 years.

Software is a research product.  
Like articles and datasets, it should be **cited** so others can acknowledge your work, find the exact version you used, and understand how your software contributed to their results.

Your software becomes **citable** as soon as it includes:

1. **Structured citation metadata**, such as a `CITATION.cff` file.  
2. **A public location where the code is available**.  
3. **A stable version** someone can reference.

A DOI is *optional* but valuable. It strengthens citability by giving each version a persistent identifier.

So far in this lesson, you have:

- shared a public repository  
- added a license  
- added a `CITATION.cff` file  

In this episode, you will create a **GitHub release** and learn how DOIs fit into software citation workflows.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Some learners may feel anxious about creating a DOI.  
Reassure them that:

- a DOI is not required for citability  
- Zenodo is free and widely used  
- they can watch the demo and complete the steps later

**Why this episode matters to researchers:** this is where journal and funder requirements actually bite. "The journal wants a citable code deposit" means, concretely, a tagged release with a DOI, and after this episode you can say that sentence and demonstrate the twenty-minute path to compliance. The DOI is also the moment their software starts accruing countable citations, the currency their review committees already understand.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## What Makes Software Citable?

Software is citable when:

- it includes authorship and version information  
- the referenced version is stable  
- others can access the code  

A DOI **enhances** these qualities, but does not define them.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Why add a DOI?

A DOI is helpful for:

- increasing visibility and discoverability  
- long-term persistence  
- citing *exact* versions  
- meeting journal and funder expectations  

But the core citability comes from your metadata and release process.

A useful way to hold the difference: a DOI is a permanent address, a URL is a sticky note. The GitHub URL points at wherever the code happens to live today. Rename the repo, change the username, or watch the platform fold (Gitorious did, Google Code did) and the note falls off. The DOI is registered infrastructure, the same DataCite plumbing behind dataset DOIs, and it resolves no matter where the object moves.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Create a Release in GitHub

A release captures a specific version of your software.  
It is the snapshot that others can cite.

### Steps

1. Open your GitHub repository.  
2. Select **Releases → Draft a new release**.  
3. Create a tag such as `v0.1.0`.  
4. Add release notes summarizing changes.  
5. Publish the release.

Creating a release does not change your `CITATION.cff` file. GitHub builds the "Cite this repository" panel from the file on your default branch. After you publish a release, update the `version` and `date-released` fields in `CITATION.cff` if you want the citation to point at that specific release.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

You might wonder why we chose `v0.1.0`. This follows **Semantic Versioning** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes (e.g., `1.0.0`)
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner (e.g., `0.1.0` -> `0.2.0`)
- **PATCH** version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes (e.g., `0.1.1`)

Starting with `0.x.x` indicates your software is in initial development and the API is not yet stable.

**If a project doesn't use semantic versioning at all,** the README should instruct users to cite the commit hash instead of a version number, so the exact state of the code that produced a result can still be pinned down (Katz et al., 2019: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08674>).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 1: What belongs in a release?

Take one minute to reflect:

- What information would help a future you understand what changed in this version?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Useful release notes include:

- what changed  
- what was added or removed  
- what bugs were fixed  
- what might break for users  
- anything important about reproducibility  

Clear release notes help both people and tools interpret your software’s evolution.

## Minting a DOI with Zenodo Sandbox

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

### Say this out loud before you screen share

Use `sandbox.zenodo.org`, not production Zenodo. Real Zenodo records and DOIs are persistent and cannot be deleted, so they are not appropriate for practice. Say it before you share your screen, and have helpers watch for learners who, by habit, land on `zenodo.org`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To practice minting a DOI without polluting the permanent scholarly record, we will use **Zenodo Sandbox**. It works exactly like the real Zenodo but is for testing.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: caution

### Practice on the sandbox, not real Zenodo

Real Zenodo records are permanent: a published DOI cannot be deleted. Use <https://sandbox.zenodo.org> for this exercise, and switch to real Zenodo only when you are depositing software you actually want on the scholarly record.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Predict: what happens when you publish?

Your GitHub repository is connected to Zenodo and you publish a new release. Predict: what does Zenodo do, with no further action from you?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Zenodo detects the release, downloads and archives a snapshot of the repository at that tag, and mints a permanent DOI for it. The archived version no longer depends on GitHub staying online.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### The Complete 6-Step Workflow

**Step 1: Log in to Zenodo with GitHub**

- Visit <https://sandbox.zenodo.org>
- Click "Log in with GitHub"
- Authorize Zenodo to access your repositories

![Zenodo's GitHub page walks you through the same three steps: flip the switch on a repository, create a release, and get a DOI badge.](fig/zenodo-get-started.png){alt="Zenodo Sandbox 'Get started' panel showing three numbered steps: Flip the switch, Create a release, and Get the badge."}

**Step 2: Enable your repository (toggle ON)**

- Go to **Settings → GitHub** in Zenodo Sandbox
- Find your repository in the list
- Toggle the switch to **ON** (green)
- This tells Zenodo to watch for new releases

![In Zenodo Sandbox under **Settings → GitHub**, find your repository and flip its switch to ON so Zenodo archives each new release.](fig/zenodo-github-toggle.png){alt="Zenodo Sandbox GitHub repositories list with the software-demo row highlighted and its toggle switched ON."}

**Step 3: Create GitHub Release (tag v0.1.0)**

- Go to your GitHub repository
- Click **Releases → Draft a new release**
- Create a tag: `v0.1.0`
- Add release notes describing what's in this version
- Click **Publish release**

![On GitHub's "Draft a new release" form: choose or create a tag such as `v0.1.0`, add a release title, describe what's in the release, then click **Publish release** (below the fold).](fig/draft-a-release.png){alt="GitHub's Draft a new release form with the tag selector, release title field, and release notes editor highlighted and numbered one through three."}


**Step 4: Zenodo auto-archives and mints DOI**

- Zenodo automatically detects your new release
- Creates an archived snapshot
- Assigns a permanent DOI
- Wait a few minutes for processing

**Step 5: Add DOI badge to your README**

- Copy the DOI badge from your Zenodo record
- Add it to the top of your README:
```markdown
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.123456.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.123456)
```

**Step 6: Update your CFF file with your DOI**

- Add the DOI to your `CITATION.cff`:
```yaml
doi: 10.5281/zenodo.123456
```

**Result:** You now have LICENSE, CITATION.cff, and DOI.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: caution

### What the DOI actually archived

Zenodo archived the repository **as it existed the moment you clicked Publish release**. That snapshot is fixed. The `CITATION.cff` edit you just made in Step 6, and any later README or metadata changes, update the live GitHub repository and will be captured by your *next* release, not the one already archived. If you want the archived snapshot itself to contain the DOI, make a new release after updating the file.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

### Do not rush the snapshot idea

This point is subtle and important, so slow down. Say: "GitHub is the live working copy; Zenodo archived what existed at release time." Then ask a learner to restate, in their own words, the difference between a post-release GitHub edit and the already-archived release snapshot. If they can restate it, they have the key mental model of the episode.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### If Zenodo can't see your repository

Zenodo only lists repositories you have admin rights on. For an organization repo, an org owner may need to approve Zenodo's access first; for this exercise, forking under your personal account avoids the problem entirely. (Keep the sandbox rule in mind too: a `10.5072/...` sandbox DOI is for practice, never for a paper or a real `CITATION.cff`.)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

With the release published and the DOI minted, the citable-software chain is complete. Here is how the pieces you have added map onto FAIR:

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Now You Have Everything

- ✅ **F - Findable:** Added DOI, CITATION.cff, rich metadata
- ✅ **A - Accessible:** Public GitHub, archived on Zenodo
- ✅ **I - Interoperable:** Standard formats (YAML, CFF)
- ✅ **R - Reusable:** LICENSE (BSD-3), README with setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Check your work

Compare your fork against the [`after-release` reference branch][branch-after-release] on the [demo repository][demo-repo]. It shows the target state after this episode: a tagged release and a `CITATION.cff` updated with the DOI.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

With the DOI minted, one practical question remains, and it is the one researchers will bring straight to you: *which* DOI do they actually cite?

### Supporting others: which DOI do I cite?

Zenodo mints two DOIs for every project, and the distinction is worth knowing cold. Librarians already have it: it is the work versus the edition, "cite the exact edition you quoted" versus "refer to the work as a whole."

- **Version DOI** points to one exact release. Cite this when the precise software state matters for reproducibility, such as the version that produced a paper's results.
- **Concept DOI** points to the project across all versions and always resolves to the latest. Cite this when you want to refer to the software in general.

A safe default to teach: cite the **version DOI** in a methods section, and use the **concept DOI** in a README or project page. And if a repository ever has both a `CITATION.cff` and a `.zenodo.json`, remember that Zenodo uses the `.zenodo.json` for the archived release metadata.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

### Debrief prompt for support-staff learners

Once the DOI appears, ask: "Which DOI would you tell the researcher to put in the methods section, the version DOI or the concept DOI, and why?" Expected answer: the **version DOI** for exact reproducibility (the state that produced the results); the **concept DOI** to refer to the project in general. This turns the mechanic into an advising decision they will actually be asked to make.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Whichever DOI you cite, durability is the whole point: **even if GitHub disappears, your DOI still works.** The GitHub-Zenodo link works like a deposit, so each release is archived at CERN, independent of GitHub's fate. The workshop can burn down; the deposited copy survives.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler

### Going further: Software Heritage

Zenodo archives a snapshot of your code at release time. [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) goes further: it continuously crawls GitHub, GitLab, and other forges and archives *everything*, assigning a **SWHID** (Software Heritage Identifier) to every file, directory, commit, and release.

A SWHID looks like this:

```
swh:1:rel:22ece559cc7cc2364edc5e5593d63ae8bd229f9f
```

It points to an exact, immutable snapshot that survives forge closures (Gitorious shut down in 2015; Google Code in 2016, both making thousands of repos unreachable). Your Zenodo DOI is the right identifier for citation; a SWHID is the long-term preservation record.

**To find and record your SWHID:**

1. Go to <https://archive.softwareheritage.org/>
2. Paste your GitHub repository URL into the search box
3. If your repo is already archived, copy the SWHID for your release
4. If it hasn't been crawled yet, click **Save code now** to trigger immediate archival
5. Once archived, add the SWHID to your `CITATION.cff`:

```yaml
repository-artifact: "swh:1:rel:22ece559cc7cc2364edc5e5593d63ae8bd229f9f"
```

This approach is recommended in the 2026 *CODE Beyond FAIR* roadmap (Di Cosmo et al., *Scientific Data*).

### Going further: FORCE11 Software Citation resources

The FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group produced practical checklists and a deeper look at implementation challenges, useful if you're setting up citation practices for a whole lab or department rather than one repository:

## Challenge 2: Why are versioned DOIs important?

Why might it matter that a DOI points to a *specific* release rather than the whole project?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Versioned DOIs:

- support reproducibility by identifying an exact snapshot  
- prevent confusion when the software changes  
- allow users to cite precisely the version they used  
- support FAIR4RS and publisher guidelines  

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Software is citable as soon as it includes a citation file and a stable version.  
- GitHub releases create versioned snapshots for citation.  
- DOIs are optional but strengthen discoverability, persistence, and reproducibility.  
- Zenodo can automatically mint a DOI for each GitHub release.
