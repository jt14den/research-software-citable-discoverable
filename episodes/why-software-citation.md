:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

* Why should research software be treated as a scholarly product?
* What are the benefits of making software citable?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

* Explain the importance of software citation for scholarly communication
* Identify how citation supports transparency, reproducibility, and credit

## Introduction

Software plays a critical role in research but has historically been under-recognized. Treating software as a citable output ensures proper attribution, improves transparency, and supports reproducibility.

Citing software with DOIs and formal metadata allows others to reference specific versions and gives creators academic credit.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Ask participants if they've ever reused software without citing it, or struggled to find or cite code used in a paper. This helps them connect to the motivation.

## Challenge 1: Who Gets Credit?

You've created a Python script that was used to generate results in a collaborative paper. The paper cites the dataset, but not the script. What’s missing?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

The script should be citable so that others can properly credit its use. Without citation metadata or a DOI, the software may go unrecognized.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

* Software is a scholarly product that should be citable
* Citation provides academic credit and supports reproducibility
* DOIs and metadata are essential for persistent, findable citation
