:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

* Why do you need a license for your code?
* How can an open-source license increase reuse and citation?
* What licenses does the UC system recommend?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

* Explain why unlicensed software is legally restricted
* Describe the main categories of open-source licenses
* Choose an appropriate license for a UC research project
* Add a license file to a GitHub repository
* Identify UC resources for licensing decisions

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Why licensing matters

When researchers publish code without a license, most people assume it is "public."
Legally, it is not. Copyright law applies automatically. Without a license:

* others cannot reuse, modify, or redistribute the code
* collaboration becomes uncertain and risky
* the sustainability of the project suffers

Clear licensing communicates permission and expectations.
This reduces friction and supports open, reproducible research.

### UC Context: Working with Tech Transfer

At UC, software created using university resources is typically owned by The Regents of the University of California. Before releasing code under an open-source license, check with your campus Tech Transfer office to:

* Verify ownership
* Ensure no third-party restrictions apply
* Select the appropriate license for your project

Each UC campus has specific processes - this lesson focuses on general best practices.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Understanding license categories

Open-source licenses fall into two broad groups.

### Permissive licenses

**Examples: BSD, MIT, Apache 2.0**

These allow broad reuse with minimal restrictions.
Anyone can copy, modify, or redistribute the code.
They are common in research because they're simple and maximize flexibility.

**The UC system recommends BSD licenses** as the first choice for most projects because they:

* originated at UC Berkeley
* are simple to understand
* protect both the institution and authors
* integrate well with most other licenses
* have minimal restrictions

### Copyleft licenses

**Example: GPL 2.0**

These require that derivative works also remain open-source.
This protects openness across the lifecycle of a project.

### Note on GPL 3.0

The UC system does **not recommend GPL 3.0** for university-owned software due to patent provisions that may conflict with UC policies. If you need copyleft protection, consult your campus Tech Transfer office about GPL 2.0 or alternatives.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## How to choose a license for your UC project

The UC Open Source Software Workgroup identified five "low-risk" licenses suitable for most projects. Here's a decision guide:

``` mermaid
graph TD
    Start[Starting a new UC research software project?] --> Check{Do you have<br/>special requirements?}
    
    Check -->|No special needs| BSD[Use BSD 3-Clause<br/>✓ UC's primary recommendation<br/>✓ Simple and protective<br/>✓ Widely compatible]
    
    Check -->|Need simpler text| MIT[Use MIT License<br/>✓ Nearly identical to BSD<br/>✓ Shorter, easier to read<br/>✓ Very popular]
    
    Check -->|Industry partnership<br/>or patent concerns| Apache[Use Apache 2.0<br/>✓ Explicit patent protection<br/>✓ Detailed contribution terms<br/>✓ Industry-friendly]
    
    Check -->|Educational focus| ECL[Consider ECL 2.0<br/>✓ Education-specific variant<br/>✓ Based on Apache 2.0]

    style ECL fill:#90EE90
    style GPL2 fill:#FFFF99
    style GPL3 fill:#FFB6C6
    style TTO fill:#87CEEB
```

### Quick reference

| Your need | Recommended license | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| Default / most projects | BSD 3-Clause | UC's standard recommendation |
| Simplest possible | MIT | Minimal text, very popular |
| Industry collaboration | Apache 2.0 | Explicit patent terms |
| Educational focus | ECL 2.0 | Education-specific variant |

**Always consult your campus Tech Transfer office before releasing UC-owned software.**

## Challenge: Add a BSD License to Your Repository

Let's add the UC-recommended BSD 3-Clause license to your demo repository:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. Name it `LICENSE`
4. Click "Choose a license template"
5. Select **BSD 3-Clause License**
6. Update the copyright holder to "The Regents of the University of California" (if UC-owned)
7. Update the year to 2025
8. Commit the file

**Verify:** Refresh your repository page. Do you see "BSD-3-Clause license" displayed?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

You should see "BSD-3-Clause license" in the repository sidebar. GitHub automatically detects and displays your license.

Your LICENSE file should start with:
```
BSD 3-Clause License

Copyright (c) 2025, The Regents of the University of California
All rights reserved.
```

If you don't see the license badge:
- Check the file is named exactly `LICENSE` (no extension)
- Verify it's in the root directory
- Confirm you committed the changes

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Communicating your license

After adding a LICENSE file, reference it in your README so users immediately understand usage terms.

Add this section near the top of your README:
```markdown
## License

This project is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
```

**Why this matters:** Users reading your README on platforms other than GitHub (Zenodo, email, exported PDFs) will see your license terms even without GitHub's automatic detection.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Exercise: License Scenarios

Which license would you recommend for each UC research scenario?

**Scenario 1:** A Python package for ecological data analysis. You want maximum adoption across academia and industry.

**Scenario 2:** A data visualization tool developed with a biotech partner who may commercialize derivatives.

**Scenario 3:** A simple utility script you're sharing with collaborators.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

**Scenario 1:** BSD 3-Clause (UC's default recommendation, maximum flexibility and adoption)

**Scenario 2:** Apache 2.0 (explicit patent protection important for industry partnerships)

**Scenario 3:** Either BSD 3-Clause or MIT (both work well for simple sharing; BSD preferred by UC)

In all cases, verify with your campus Tech Transfer office before releasing.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Summary

Licensing is foundational to making research software usable, citable, and shareable.
In this episode, you added a BSD license to a repository following UC recommendations.

::::::::::::::: keypoints

* Without a license, software is legally restricted and not reusable
* UC recommends BSD 3-Clause as the default license for most projects
* Permissive licenses (BSD, MIT, Apache 2.0) maximize flexibility and adoption
* Always consult your campus Tech Transfer office for UC-owned software
* GitHub makes adding standard licenses straightforward
