:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

* Why do you need a license for your code?
* How can an open-source license increase reuse and citation?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

* Explain the legal importance of software licensing
* Choose and apply an open-source license to a code repository

## Introduction

Without a license, your code is "all rights reserved" by default — meaning others cannot legally reuse, modify, or redistribute it. Adding a license signals to others how they can use your work and increases trust and adoption.

Open-source licenses like MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL let others build on your work while ensuring proper attribution.

Briefly review the difference between permissive and copyleft licenses if there's time. Focus on showing how easy it is to add a license file via GitHub.

## Challenge 1: What Happens Without a License?

Imagine someone wants to use your script in their project. What are the risks if there's no license file?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Legally, they cannot reuse or redistribute it. This may discourage collaboration or citation. Adding a license removes this barrier.

3. GitHub provides a license template dropdown — choose MIT, Apache 2.0, or another
4. Commit the file
