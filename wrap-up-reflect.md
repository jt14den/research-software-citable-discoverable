## Curation Work, Not Code Work

The repository this lesson started with was fragile in a specific, diagnosable way: no rights statement, no citation record, no version anyone could pin, no description a search could find. Each episode added one piece of scholarly infrastructure, and none of it required writing code. That is the pattern worth carrying out of the room: making software citable and discoverable is curation work, and this audience already does that for a living.

## Your FAIR4RS Checklist

Congratulations! You've transformed fragile research software into a FAIR software project.

### What We Covered Today:

✅ **F - Findable:** Added DOI, CITATION.cff, rich metadata

✅ **A - Accessible:** Public GitHub, archived on Zenodo

✅ **I - Interoperable:** Standard formats (YAML, CFF), documented dependencies (`requirements.txt`, or `pixi.toml` on the full track)

✅ **R - Reusable:** LICENSE (BSD-3), README with setup, environment reproducibility

### From Fragile to FAIR

**Before ([`main`][branch-main], starting state):**

- ❌ No LICENSE
- ❌ No citation
- ❌ No DOI
- ❌ Minimal README

**After ([`after-metadata`][branch-after-metadata]):**

- ✅ LICENSE (BSD-3)
- ✅ CITATION.cff
- ✅ DOI from Zenodo
- ✅ README with documentation
- ✅ Community health files
- ✅ Reproducible environment *(optional pixi episode, on [`optional-pixi`][branch-optional-pixi])*

Your software is now **citable, discoverable, and reusable**.

## Reflecting on what you built

Over this session, you've learned how to make your research software more visible, citable, and impactful. These small, practical steps support scholarly communication, reproducibility, and the FAIR principles.

Use this time to reflect on what you've learned and decide on one action you'll take with your own project.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Give learners a few minutes of quiet reflection, then facilitate a group discussion. Invite volunteers to share a step they plan to take next.

**Closing pitch worth saying out loud:** for instructors, the deliverable is not the demo repo, it is a service, a consultation format and a referral map usable the week you get home. For researchers, it is a repeatable habit that costs under an hour per project: every future paper's code can either be a dead URL in five years or a citable, findable output on your record, and the difference is the checklist you now hold.

## Discussion: Choose Your Next Step

Which of the practices from today’s session will you apply to a current or future project? Share your pick with the group: making a repo public, adding a license, archiving on Zenodo, writing a README, creating a CITATION file, or something else.

## Challenge 2: Find a FAIR Win

Think of one thing you can do in under 30 minutes to make your software more FAIR.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Examples:

* Add a LICENSE file
* Write a short README
* Register your ORCID on Zenodo
* Create a GitHub release

### Supporting others: taking this back to your desk

If you came to this lesson to support researchers rather than to publish your own code, your "next step" is a service, not a single repo. Two things make that practical.

**A 5-minute consultation checklist.** When a researcher brings you a repository, walk it in this order and name the one highest-value fix. It works for the same reason a reference interview works: a practiced sequence of questions that turns a vague ask into a concrete next step.

- [ ] **License** present, and ownership question asked? (Refer to Tech Transfer if unclear.)
- [ ] **CITATION.cff** present and rendering GitHub's "Cite this repository" panel?
- [ ] **Release + DOI** for the version that matters? (Version vs. concept DOI clear?)
- [ ] **README** that a stranger understands in 30 seconds?
- [ ] **Metadata**: description, ORCIDs, keywords, related works?

**A campus referral map.** You are the router, not the whole network. A liaison librarian does not answer every question; they know where every question goes. Know who owns each escalation before you need them:

- **Ownership / IP / commercialization** → Technology Transfer / IP office
- **Sensitive or restricted data in a repo** → research compliance / IRB / data governance
- **Institutional repository, preservation, DOIs at scale** → library repository / scholarly comms team
- **Open-source strategy, policy, community** → your campus OSPO
- **Contested authorship or credit** → surface to the collaborators; do not arbitrate

Fill in the actual names and contacts for your campus, and you have a reusable service, not a one-off answer.

### Make it a local service map

Have each support-staff learner write down one campus referral they still need to identify after the workshop: Tech Transfer, research computing, the data repository, information security, the grants office, or scholarly communications. Naming a real gap turns the demo into a local service map they can actually use on Monday.

## Challenge 3: Build your campus playbook *(supporting others)*

If you are here to support researchers, your take-home artifact is a reusable playbook, not a single repo. Using the checklist and referral map above as a template, write down:

1. The **5 triage questions** you would ask of any repository a researcher brings you.
2. For each referral category (IP/ownership, sensitive data, institutional repository, OSPO, contested authorship), the **actual office or person** at your institution it routes to.
3. One **"I can answer this myself" vs. "I refer this"** line you feel least sure about, to follow up on later.

Pair up and trade playbooks: can your partner tell, from your map, where to send a real question? Revise anything that isn't clear enough to hand to a colleague.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

There is no single right answer; the artifact is the point. A strong playbook names real contacts (not just "Tech Transfer" but the office and a link), and is specific enough that another person on your team could use it without you in the room. If you could not fill a referral line, that gap is itself a useful finding to take back.

### Going further: the next layer

Citable and discoverable is the foundation, not the finish line. Once a project has a license, a citation file, and a DOI, the next questions concern *project health*: is it secure, well-maintained, and safe to build on? [OpenSSF Scorecards](https://securityscorecards.dev/) score a repository against those practices and are becoming a common signal across the open-source ecosystem, and [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) does the same specifically for license and copyright compliance — both are separate skills from what we covered here. On the credit side, the [FORCE11 Software Citation Principles](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86) are the standard the `CITATION.cff` work in this lesson rests on. All three are good next stops for anyone building out an academic OSPO's teaching.
