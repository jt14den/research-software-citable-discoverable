This lesson introduces practical steps researchers can take to make their software citable, discoverable, and easier to reuse. It focuses on high-impact, low-effort practices such as improving metadata, adding a CITATION.cff file, choosing an open-source license, using GitHub effectively, and adopting lightweight tools to support reproducibility.

The lesson is intended for researchers who write code as part of their work but do not necessarily identify as software developers. Graduate students, research staff, and librarians who support research software will also find the material useful.

Learners will make small, meaningful improvements to an existing GitHub repository and see how these practices increase attribution, transparency, and research impact. These steps align with principles from the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) community.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, learners will be able to:

- explain why research software should be cited and attributed.
- add and validate a CITATION.cff file in a GitHub repository.
- choose and apply an appropriate open-source license.
- improve software discoverability through documentation and metadata.
- understand how packaging tools like pixi can support usability and reproducibility.
- describe how these practices support FAIR principles for research software.
- identify small, high-value improvements that increase the visibility and impact of their software.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this lesson, learners should be able to:

- navigate GitHub in a web browser (view files, edit files, open issues).
- understand basic Git concepts such as commits and repositories.
- edit plain-text files in any text editor.

You don't need any prior experience with software packaging, metadata standards, or licensing.
