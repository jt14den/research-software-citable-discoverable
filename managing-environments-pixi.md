:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- Why do software projects need well defined environments?
- How can `pixi` help learners run the same code the developer used?
- How does environment management improve the reproducibility and citability of research software?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain why environment definition is central to reproducible research.
- Create a minimal `pixi.toml` file for a project.
- Use `pixi` to run Python or R code inside a clean, isolated environment.
- Describe how environment files support FAIR software and citation practices.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Why Environments Matter

Research software often “works on my machine” and nowhere else.  
Different operating systems, outdated packages, and mismatched library versions frequently break code.

Environment management reduces this friction because it captures:

- the exact language versions used  
- required packages  
- the dependency set needed to run the software  
- instructions for reproducing the execution environment  

For researchers, this supports:

- reproducibility  
- clearer documentation  
- better long term maintenance  
- a stronger foundation for citation and reuse  

`pixi` is a modern, fast environment manager that works for Python, R, and many other languages.

## Installing pixi

Full installation docs: <https://pixi.sh>

Common installation for macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```

Windows users can install via MSI installer or `winget`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

`pixi` includes its own language runtimes.  
Learners do not need preinstalled Python, R, compilers, or system packages.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Creating a New pixi Project

Create a directory and initialize a pixi project:

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
pixi init
```

This creates a `pixi.toml` file, which documents your environment.

Add Python:

```bash
pixi add python
```

Add the NumPy package:

```bash
pixi add numpy
```

Add R and one package:

```bash
pixi add r
pixi add r-dplyr
```

Your `pixi.toml` is now a reproducible record of all dependencies needed for the software.

---

## Running Code With pixi

Run Python code:

```bash
pixi run python script.py
```

Run R code:

```bash
pixi run Rscript analysis.R
```

Every command is executed *inside* the environment described by `pixi.toml`.

This makes it easier for others to test, cite, extend, and build upon your work.

## How Environments Support Citation and Reuse

A reusable research software project contains not only code, but:

- licensing  
- authorship and citation metadata (`CITATION.cff`)  
- version information  
- a documented environment  

Including `pixi.toml` in your repository or DOI deposit helps future readers:

- recreate the execution environment  
- verify results  
- adapt your code for new analyses  
- evaluate whether the software is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)  

When publishing your software, include:

- the `pixi.toml` file  
- instructions such as:  
  ```bash
  pixi run python script.py
  ```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Challenge: Add a new dependency

Use `pixi` to add `pandas` or `r-ggplot2` to your project.

What changed in your `pixi.toml` file?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

```bash
pixi add pandas
```

or:

```bash
pixi add r-ggplot2
```

You should see the new package listed under `[project.dependencies]` in your `pixi.toml`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Reproducible environments reduce troubleshooting and support more reusable software.
- `pixi` provides fast, cross platform environment management.
- The `pixi.toml` file acts as documentation that supports citation and FAIR4RS principles.
- Use `pixi run` to execute Python or R code inside a reproducible environment.
